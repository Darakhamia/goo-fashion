/**
 * Deciding whether two rows are the same piece in another colour.
 *
 * The catalogue already knows how to show colour variants: rows sharing a
 * `variant_group_id` collapse into one card with a swatch row, and the CSV
 * importer forms those groups inside a batch. What had no answer was the URL
 * importer — a store collected one page at a time, so every colourway arrived
 * as its own product and the swatch row stayed empty.
 *
 * Two signals, and they are not equal:
 *
 *   The page's own links.  A colour row is usually a row of links, one per
 *   colourway, so the page states outright which addresses are the same piece.
 *   An address either matches a row we have or it does not; there is nothing to
 *   judge, and this is the signal to trust.
 *
 *   Brand and name.  What is left when the store switches colours with script
 *   instead of links — and the only signal across stores, since a colour row
 *   links that store's own pages and never another site's. So it is asked on
 *   every import, beside the links. Here the judgement has to be
 *   conservative, because the cost of a wrong answer is not a missing swatch —
 *   it is two different coats shown to a shopper as one coat in two colours.
 *
 * So the name test below insists on the same piece by `samePiece` — the name
 * with brand, colour and filler removed, matched exactly, never by prefix.
 * "Wool Coat" and "Wool Coat Long" share a prefix and are two products.
 *
 * The brand is the maker, however each store spells it: "adidas" on adidas.com
 * is "adidas Originals" on a reseller, "Carhartt" is "Carhartt WIP", a card
 * saved before its brand was read has none. The name test used to take our
 * spelling only, and the importer read only the cards filed under exactly that
 * spelling — so one jacket collected from two sites stayed two cards.
 *
 * It also insists the colours differ. Two rows of the same piece in the same
 * colour are not variants of each other — they are the same thing twice, which
 * is a different problem with a different fix (the retailer list, see
 * `same-item.ts`). The price never enters it: one colourway of a piece often
 * costs more than another.
